# EDA's
In this repository, I share a few projects focused on Exploratory Data Analysis. The goal is to extract information on different Datasets, exercising Data Analysis and Visualisation skills.

## Projects

### [Kaggle EDA Challenge 2020](https://github.com/negrinij/EDA/blob/main/KaggleEDA/2020-kaggle-eda-competition.ipynb)

- This notebook is a exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the most comprehensive dataset available on the state of machine learning and data science today
- The survey answers covered demographic, education, employment, and technology usage to learn more about data science practitioners in 2020.
- Key Insights include:
  - India, the USA and Brazil are the countries with the most survey participants
  - India is the country with the highest number of young participants (18-21 years old)
  - Female participation range from 15-20% across different countries
  - 39% of participants hold a Masters and 34% Bachelors degrees, demonstrating the importance of Formal Education
  - Almost 60% of doctorates are working as Research Scientists. Also, PhD holders account for only 7% of currently unemployed. Unfortunately, 42% of currently unemployed hold a Bachelor degree
