Overview\nUbiquant Investment (Beijing) Co., Ltd is a leading domestic quantitative hedge fund based in China. Established in 2012, they rely on international talents in math and computer science along with cutting-edge technology to drive quantitative financial market investment. Overall, Ubiquant is committed to creating long-term stable returns for investors.\n\nIn this Kaggle competition, the goal is to build a time-series model that forecasts an investment's return rate. The dataset contains historical prices to train and test our models.\n\nThe dataset contains 300 features to describe the samples, however, they are all anonymized. Below is a summary of the dataset:\n\n* **time_id** - The ID code for the time the data was gathered. The time IDs are in order, but the real-time between the time IDs is not constant and will likely be shorter for the final private test set than in the training set.\n* **investment_id** - The ID code for an investment. Not all investments have data in all-time IDs.\n* **target** - The target.\n* **f_0 to f_299** - Anonymized features generated from market data.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport gc\nimport numpy as np\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nimport lightgbm as lgbm\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-08-10T20:53:44.676927Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-08-10T20:53:44.678022Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-08-10T20:53:47.290381Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-08-10T20:53:44.677675Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-08-10T20:53:47.289215Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def basic_EDA(df):\n    size = df.shape\n    sum_null = df.isnull().sum().sum()\n    return print(\"Number of Samples: %d,\\nNumber of Features: %d,\\nNull Entries: %d\" %(size[0],size[1], sum_null))","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-08-10T20:53:47.292142Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-08-10T20:53:47.292442Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-08-10T20:53:47.298959Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-08-10T20:53:47.292411Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-08-10T20:53:47.297727Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2.

","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 3. Future Work\n\nWith this initial analysis, we now have a better foundation to start our modeling. It is important to highlight that this is a time-series application, and we need to train and test the model respecting the sample sequence (i.e. do not shuffle to create the train/val/test sets). A few guidelines I use for this challenge:\n\n* **Use a method to understand the most important features** - I tend to use LGBM or Random Forest models to provide this insight\n* **Data transformation** - Sometimes log or power transformations might be useful to transform variables into \"more\" Normal distribution\n* **Spend some time trying to create new features** - I usually focus on the most important features and try to create new features from there\n* **Play with Time-Series windows** - From my experience, sometimes training the final model on the whole dataset is not helpful according to the test set being used in Kaggle. Test if there are optimal windows to be used for training to achieve a higher score\n* **Optimise the model parameters** - Use Optuna or other automated tools to find the best hyperparameters\n* **Use Ensemble models** - Experiment with different combinations of models to create a more powerful predictor\n\nI hope this was helpful.
